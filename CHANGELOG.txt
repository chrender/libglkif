 + libglkif was built from code in Andrew Plotkin's github repository. It
   represents an interface translating fizmo's Z-machine output operations
   into GLK-invocations. The current code should be seen as a first
   experimental release. Please note that bug reports should be sent to
  "fizmo@spellbreaker.org" instead of sending them to Andrew Plotkin.
 - The "fizmo-glktermw" frontend relies on libglkif for it's GLK output.
